# Rick And Morty 

It is a simple flutter application that fetches the characters from an API and displays the characters that are in the show with their details.

## Main packages I used 

I used the provider package for state management, to handle the data and the fetching for the characters from the API, along with the http package to send http requests to the API. I used flutter_luncher_icons and flutter_native_splash to help me to setup the splash screen and the app icon. Finally, I used The [Rick And Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation) to fetch the data, make sure to see the documentation of the API by clicking on the link.
